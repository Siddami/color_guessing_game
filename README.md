# Color Guessing Game 🎨🎮

## Project Overview

A interactive, browser-based color guessing game that challenges players to identify the correct color through visual recognition and quick thinking (Don't play if color blind...).

## Project Motivation

This project was developed as a Frontend Intern Task to demonstrate:

- Proficiency in vanilla JavaScript
- Understanding of DOM manipulation
- Ability to create interactive web applications
- Skills in responsive design and user experience

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and content
- **CSS3**: Responsive styling and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic and interactivity
- **No External Libraries**: Pure vanilla implementation
